11.1 Design Questions

1-The minimum amount of time data_ready must remain asserted for 2 cycles to ensure store then from store to sort. Also, data_ready has to be valid for 1 clock cycle since it enters to sort state.

2-
idle: if(data_ready == 0) goto idle;
store: if (data_ready == 0) got eidle;
	reg[5] = data
	err = 0
sort1: reg[1] = reg[2]
sort2: reg[2] = reg[3]
sort3: reg[3] = reg[4]
sort4: reg[4] = reg[5]
add1: reg[6] = reg[1] * reg[2] 
	if(V) goto eidle
		goto idle
add2: reg[7] = reg[4] * reg[3]
	if(V) goto eidle
		goto idle
add3: reg[0] = reg[6] + reg[7]
	if(V) goto eidle
		goto idle
eidle: err = 1
	if(data_ready == 1) goto store
	if(data_ready == 0) goto eidle

3- Filtered image was blurred. It makes sence since because filtering involved the averager.
4- It uses fopen, fscanf, fseek, ftell and fwrite like C syntax to grab file and manipulate it.
5- Like said, fscanf, fseek, ftell and other file handler C syntax code is used.
