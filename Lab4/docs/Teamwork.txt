2) We efficiently used the office hours as well as worked hard enough to get our lab done on time. I mostly worked on debugging the code which took a lot of time since there always pops an error no matter what. My partner helped me out about the concepts on how to approach on controller and avg_four codes. He gave me ideas on how to do it efficiently and error free. However sometimes we switched our roles and controlled our code and how it functioned. 

3)This week we met 4 times during and after the office hours. We used text messaging pretty frequently. 

4) I contribute the team by debugging and evaluating the design as well as designing the how the code structured for the labs. I did QA by testing the design looking at the wave forms to identify. Coming up with design was also my contribution through out the lab and post lab.

5)My teammate contributed the team by forming the logic of each step in the lab. I learned to devote a lot of time and not to give up easily during these labs. He taught me how to differentiate blocks in the design.
